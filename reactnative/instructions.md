# ReactJs Exercise

```
TIMEBOX:    2-3 hours max. We mean it!
LANGUAGES:  React Native
TESTS:      Feel free to use any UI library if want to.
DOCS:       nice to have, but not mandatory
```

# Overview

- This exercise is to implement the best possible solution to below exercises in the time alloted. We're evaluating your ability to take a set of requirements and spike a holistic solution that demonstrates craftsmanship, thoughtfulness and attention to user experience.
- This is **NOT** a test of how well you know React Native, nor should you try to impress us with overly clever and obtuse solutions. If you want to impress us, build something that is beautiful, intuitive and easy to debug/test/extend :smiley: .
- Ideally your solution would have some way to run locally and visualize the results in a plan file so we can fully analyze the experience and not just the source code.

# Task

- Create a new React Native project using your preferred setup (e.g., Create React-native App).
- Perform CRUD operations with the REST API. Use redux with get data from employee list server and display in first page and create separate modal popup view for application add, update and delete operations.
- Fetch data from the following API endpoint: http://dummy.restapiexample.com/
- Implement error handling in case the API request fails or returns an error response.
- Add a loading state while the data is being fetched.

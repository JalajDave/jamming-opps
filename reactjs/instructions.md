# ReactJs Exercise
```
TIMEBOX:    2-3 hours max. We mean it!
LANGUAGES:  React JS
TESTS:      plan file
DOCS:       nice to have, but not mandatory
```

# Overview
- This exercise is to implement the best possible solution to below exercises in the time alloted. We're evaluating your ability to take a set of requirements and spike a holistic solution that demonstrates craftsmanship, thoughtfulness and attention to user experience. 
- This is **NOT** a test of how well you know React JS, nor should you try to impress us with overly clever and obtuse solutions. If you want to impress us, build something that is beautiful, intuitive and easy to debug/test/extend :smiley: .
- Ideally your solution would have some way to run locally and visualize the results in a plan file so we can fully analyze the experience and not just the source code.


# Task
- Create a new React.js project using your preferred setup (e.g., Create React App).
- Fetch data from the following API endpoint: https://reqres.in/
- Render the data in a list format, displaying the first_name, last_name, email and avatar of each item.
- Apply basic styling to the list to make it visually appealing.
- Implement error handling in case the API request fails or returns an error response.
- Add a loading state while the data is being fetched.
- Add pagination on the table.

# Bonus
Answer following -
1. Write tests for any important functionality using a testing library of your choice (e.g., Jest, React Testing Library).
2. Use Redux Toolkit.
